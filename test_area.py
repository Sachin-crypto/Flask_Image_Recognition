# Create docstring here
"""
This module contains unit tests for the Flask app.

It imports necessary libraries and functions for the application to work,
including Flask for web framework functionality,
rendering HTML templates, and handling HTTP requests. It also imports
functions from the 'model' module for image preprocessing and making predictions.

The application allows users to upload an image, preprocess it using the
'preprocess_img' function, and predict a result using the
'predict_result' function. The results are then displayed to the user.
